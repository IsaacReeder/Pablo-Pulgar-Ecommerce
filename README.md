            Pablo Pulgar is a Spanish artist born in Madrid. He has exhibited his work in several galleries in Spain and the Netherlands. 
            With a background in graffiti and graphic design, his work lives between the digital and physical world; where the media used 
            plays a critical role. His work ranges from painting and collage to fanzines, photography, and video installations. Fashion, 
            popular culture, and music references are combined heavy usage of typography and vibrant color to create digital hand-made 
            landscapes with a sense for formal art.
